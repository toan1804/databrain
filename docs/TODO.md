# Known gaps to fix later

Found in reviews and left for a later release on purpose. Each says what goes wrong; remove an entry when it is fixed.

## Single program (verify on Windows before relying on it)

- An update while an MCP client is connected: the installer may end the MCP session (`databrain.exe mcp`), or hit "file in use" on the `databrain-mcp.exe` launcher.
- If an MCP client kills `databrain-mcp.exe` without closing its stdin, the child `databrain.exe mcp` may keep running (no job object ties them).
- `databrain-jobs run` / `list` output in a terminal goes through the GUI-subsystem launcher's console attach; check it prints in cmd and PowerShell.

## Connector core (review of 2026-11-12; see [CONNECTOR_CORE.md](CONNECTOR_CORE.md))

Every finding of the review was fixed on 2026-11-13, with the never-read corpus and the whole-vs-pieces property (`crates/connector-core/tests/classify_corpus.rs`), tri-state `Session::transaction_state` with the unused `Capabilities` fields removed, keyword and positional secrets in redaction, and one scanner for strings and comments (`skip_token`). A `Session::supports(Feature)` enum wasn't added: the optional features already say "not supported" through their own return values (`object_versions` → `None`, `check_sql` → `false`). The redaction functions keep their own, dialect-free lexing on purpose: they scrub any text (history, logs, error messages) without knowing its database. Since 2026-11-14 the SQL secret rules read one tokenizer in six readings, sessions run only `Checked` statements or `Statement::internal` SQL, and each statement is parsed once (`ParsedStatement`); the splitter stays the authority on where statements end, so a gap in sqlparser's tokenizer can't become a split failure.

Idea still open:

1. **Function allow-list for reads** (medium; a product decision). Unparsed text, hidden statements and the acting-function list are covered; left is treating a SELECT that calls a function outside the built-in list as `Unknown`. Only SQL Server (functions can run extended procedures) and Oracle (autonomous-transaction functions) need it, and there it would refuse many ordinary reads on read-only connections (`regexp_count`, `sys_context`, `dbms_lob.substr`, any user function) until the built-in lists are complete. The AI path already asks about such functions (`unknown_functions`).

## AI assistant (review of 2026-11-14)

The review's privacy gaps and bugs were fixed on 2026-11-15 (a connection's rules hold wherever it is reached from, jobs are reviewed again when they run, the row cap, stream errors, the job tools' silent fallbacks). Left:

- **Tool arguments are read from loose JSON.** The job tools now refuse a schedule or an export format they can't read, but the other tools still take each field by hand (`args.get(..)`), with undocumented aliases (`insert`, `upsert`, `mirror`). Typed structs (`deny_unknown_fields`) that also produce the schema sent to the model would remove the class.
- **Table rules know only the first schema of a `search_path`.** Unqualified names are completed with the schema the server reports as current (`QueryEngine::default_namespace`, asked before the assistant's queries and jobs on a connection with rules). A table that isn't in that schema but in a later one of the path is still checked under the first; and an output the user made after `SET search_path` in their own session is checked under the connection's schema, not that session's. BigQuery, SQLite and DuckDB keep their fixed defaults.
- **PII rules follow tables, not views.** A view over a masked column is another table to the rules: only a rule without a table (`email`) masks it.
- **Notes about dropped or renamed tables stay** (hidden from the model, never removed), and there is no limit on the number of notes or proposals.
- **A schema that becomes empty keeps its tables in the AI's catalog** until the next full index (not confirmed; `kn_replace_schema_read` with an empty list).
- **Workspace SQLite on the async runtime**: `knowledge::retrieve` and a schema's index write run on the runtime's threads; a learn pass commits once per sighting.
- **Providers**: the OpenAI-compatible stream is still read as complete when it ends without `[DONE]` or a finish reason (some local servers end that way); Gemini's `thoughtSignature` is not kept with a tool call (newer models may want it back; not confirmed); the SSE reader has no cap on one line or one event; inline completions cancelled before the first byte are counted as zero tokens.
