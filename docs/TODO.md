# Known gaps to fix later

Found in reviews and left for a later release on purpose. Each says what goes wrong; remove an entry when it is fixed.

## Single program (verify on Windows before relying on it)

- An update while an MCP client is connected: the installer may end the MCP session (`databrain.exe mcp`), or hit "file in use" on the `databrain-mcp.exe` launcher.
- If an MCP client kills `databrain-mcp.exe` without closing its stdin, the child `databrain.exe mcp` may keep running (no job object ties them).
- `databrain-jobs run` / `list` output in a terminal goes through the GUI-subsystem launcher's console attach; check it prints in cmd and PowerShell.

## Connector core (review of 2026-11-12; see [CONNECTOR_CORE.md](CONNECTOR_CORE.md))

Every finding of the review was fixed on 2026-11-13, with the never-read corpus and the whole-vs-pieces property (`crates/connector-core/tests/classify_corpus.rs`), tri-state `Session::transaction_state` with the unused `Capabilities` fields removed, keyword and positional secrets in redaction, and one scanner for strings and comments (`skip_token`). A `Session::supports(Feature)` enum wasn't added: the optional features already say "not supported" through their own return values (`object_versions` → `None`, `check_sql` → `false`). The redaction functions keep their own, dialect-free lexing on purpose: they scrub any text (history, logs, error messages) without knowing its database. Since 2026-11-14 the SQL secret rules read one tokenizer in six readings, sessions run only `Checked` statements or `Statement::internal` SQL, and each statement is parsed once (`ParsedStatement`); the splitter stays the authority on where statements end, so a gap in sqlparser's tokenizer can't become a split failure.

Idea still open:

1. **Function allow-list for reads** (medium; a product decision). Unparsed text, hidden statements and the acting-function list are covered; left is treating a SELECT that calls a function outside the built-in list as `Unknown`. Only SQL Server (functions can run extended procedures) and Oracle (autonomous-transaction functions) need it, and there it would refuse many ordinary reads on read-only connections (`regexp_count`, `sys_context`, `dbms_lob.substr`, any user function) until the built-in lists are complete. The AI path already asks about such functions (`unknown_functions`).
